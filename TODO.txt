- Clean up
  - Remove all commented out code
  - Remove all debug logging
  - CSS hygiene


- Sphere UI 
  - reset sphere rotation (really is reset of camera position)
  - rotate based on scrolling and not dragging


- State Calculator
  - Expand/collapse 
  - Matrix element data input validation
    - what can be imaginary or not
  - Create event to fire on result change
  - Option to show results as fractions
  - Option to show results in Dirac notation


- State Data View
  - Option to show amplitudes as fractions
  - Option to show amplitudes in Dirac notation


- Applying gates
  - History
    - show/hide history
    - copy history as Qskit
  - gate sequence builder
    - specify either the amplitudes, probabilities, polar or azimuth
    - given the specified value and the current position, generate 
      a gate series to get in that position
  - AngleInput component    
    - data input validation
    - on hover of content space show ew-resize cursor
    - on click and drag increment/decrement the value by some delta value
        - delta will depend on degree/radian setting
    - preview the change in the sphere visual


- Visual Style
  - set proper "active" states (test by tabbing through elements)
  - draw polar and azimuth lines and angles on hover of values
  - show possible outcome of gate
    - all gates including the rotation gates
    - show when button
      - has focus (only applies to the rotation input component)
      - has hover
        - for rotation input this includes when the dialog is open
  - Animations
    - gate change
    - gate change preview
    - wave function
  - Replace state calc png with an svg so it can be colored through the theme
  - Consider making the calculator panel a dialog or put a visual seperator between it and the other UI
  


  - UI Components
    - Create an icon button


  - BUGS!
    - Calculation precision workarounds for JS math overflow
    - showing history popups behind RadiansPicker popup.  If RadiansPicker is open don't show the other popups
    - Hide tooltip of input field when input field is in focus or active.  This is a flowbite defect.
      - create a custom component
